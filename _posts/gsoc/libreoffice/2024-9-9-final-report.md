## Hello everybody :)

LibreOffice Calc has a nice functions deck on the sidebar allowing to pick one of the many functions,
and this functions panel has some room for improvements. 
The project aims to improve this functions deck to enhance usability and functionality 
to create a better user experience.  

The project was about making these general improvements to the function deck,
but we find it better to make the enancements apply to both function deck (FD) and function wizard (FW). 
It was not always an easy thing to do it in both places, as they are in different modules and created with different code structrures.

It was really challenging working with such complex code base,
I did spend most of the time trying to find where to put what, with dozens of hours debugging. 
Actully my debugging skills has been enhanced alot with the use of debuggers like rr which is built on top of gdb.

***Project Goals:***
  - List all functions in collapsible sections (rather the current filtering per dropdown)
  - Add a help button to open the respective documentation page
  - Improve searching techniques

***Abandoned Goals:***
  - Save custom made formulas, to be used anywhere
  - Add an editor area that provides structure of the function, with:
    - Syntax highlighting and formatting â€“ with connection to referenced cells
    - Ability to drill down for better debugging process
